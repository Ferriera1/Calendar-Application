# Calendar-Application
Added some code? not sure if its correct lol. Will double back
^ code was correct 
Working on the HTML first, I added the different divs to represent the different hour blocks
added to .html a p tag to hold my clock in the header 
Added in some variables and a funtion to the .js to create a clock on the main page 
Added to the .css file to style the new clock
removed the specific past present and future classes from the html file.
created a function that compares the ids to the current hour using an if else statement. If the the current time is the same as the time in the time block then add the css for the present if current time is less than whats the time is inside the time block then the time block would be for the future and if current time is greater than the time block then the time block would be the past
